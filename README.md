This repository contains a small archive of machine learning and data science examples.
They were originally intended to act as a reference and educational resource for myself.
Maybe, for some reason, they turn out to be useful for others, too.
Most of the example notebooks contain a brief theoretical introduction followed by a small practical experiment.
